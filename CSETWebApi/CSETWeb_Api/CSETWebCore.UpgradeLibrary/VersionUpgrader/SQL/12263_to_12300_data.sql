   2. If such hardware-based MFA is not available, then mobile app-based soft tokens (preferably push notification with number matching) or emerging technology such as FIDO passkeys are used; 
   3. MFA via SMS or voice only used when no other options are possible. 

IT: All IT accounts leverage MFA to access organizational resources. Prioritize accounts with highest risk, such as privileged administrative accounts for key IT systems.</li>
<li>Same question as above but here answer for OT, if applicable.

Establish a DRP which applies to major, usually physical disruptions to service that deny access to the primary facility infrastructure for an extended period. A DRP is an information system-focused plan designed to restore operability of the target system, application, or computer facility infrastructure at an alternate site after an emergency. The DRP must provide for full restoration at the primary facility. The DRP may be supported by multiple information system contingency plans to address recovery of impacted individual systems once the alternate facility has been established. A DRP may support a Business Continuity Plan (BCP) or Continuity of Operation Plan (COOP) by recovering supporting systems for mission/business processes or mission essential functions at an alternate location.

Rationale for adding SI-13 control to HIGH baseline: OT are designed and built with certain boundary conditions, design parameters, and assumptions about their environment and mode of operation. OT may run much longer than conventional systems, allowing latent flaws that are not manifest in other environments to become effective. For example, integer overflow might never occur in systems that are re-initialized more frequently than the occurrence of the overflow. Experience and forensic studies of anomalies and incidents in OT can lead to the identification of emergent properties that were previously unknown, unexpected, or unanticipated. Preventative and restorative actions (e.g., restarting the system or application) are prudent but may not be acceptable in OT for operational reasons.
